## Abstract

This article provides a technical front-to-back analysis of the Mazda 787B,
focusing on the aerodynamic concepts that enabled both performance and
endurance reliability. The goal is not historical storytelling, but engineering
understanding, linking geometry to function.

## 1. Context and Design Constraints

Before analysing individual components, it is important to understand the
constraints under which the car was designed.

- Group C regulations
- Fuel consumption limits
- Cooling requirements of the R26B rotary engine
- 24-hour endurance reliability targets

These constraints strongly influenced the aerodynamic architecture of the car.

## 2. Front End – Pressure Management and Stability

### 2.1 Nose Geometry and Stagnation Control

The nose shape was designed to manage stagnation pressure while minimising
front axle lift. Compared to contemporaries, the 787B features:

- A relatively blunt leading edge
- Controlled pressure build-up ahead of the front axle
- Limited under-nose volume due to regulations

**Key idea:** stability over peak downforce.

### 2.2 Front Wheel Wake and Drag Control

Open wheel housings generate significant turbulence. The 787B mitigated this
through:

- Carefully shaped wheel arch exits
- Progressive body curvature to guide wheel wake outward
- Limited reliance on aggressive front devices

This reduced drag without compr
