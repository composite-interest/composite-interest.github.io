## Abstract

This article provides a technical front-to-back analysis of the Mazda 787B,
focusing on the aerodynamic concepts that enabled both performance and
endurance reliability. The goal is not historical storytelling, but engineering
understanding, linking geometry to function.

---

## 1. Context and Design Constraints

Before analysing individual components, it is important to understand the
constraints under which the car was designed.

- Group C regulations
- Fuel consumption limits
- Cooling requirements of the R26B rotary engine
- 24-hour endurance reliability targets

These constraints strongly influenced the aerodynamic architecture of the car.

---

## 2. Front End – Pressure Management and Stability

### 2.1 Nose Geometry and Stagnation Control

The nose shape was designed to manage stagnation pressure while minimising
front axle lift. Compared to contemporaries, the 787B features:

- A relatively blunt leading edge
- Controlled pressure build-up ahead of the front axle
- Limited under-nose volume due to regulations

**Key idea:** stability over peak downforce.


---

### 2.2 Front Wheel Wake and Drag Control

Open wheel housings generate significant turbulence. The 787B mitigated this
through:

- Carefully shaped wheel arch exits
- Progressive body curvature to guide wheel wake outward
- Limited reliance on aggressive front devices

This reduced drag without compromising cooling airflow.

---

## 3. Mid-Body – Cooling and Flow Preservation

### 3.1 Sidepod Inlet Design

The sidepods had to serve multiple functions:

- Engine cooling
- Oil and auxiliary systems
- Minimal disturbance to rear flow structures

The inlet positioning favoured **pressure recovery** rather than peak mass flow,
a typical endurance trade-off.

---

### 3.2 Underbody Interaction

While ground effect was limited by regulation, the underbody still played a
critical role in:

- Flow conditioning towards the diffuser
- Reducing sensitivity to ride height changes
- Maintaining performance across long stints

---

## 4. Rear End – Downforce with Efficiency

### 4.1 Diffuser Geometry

The diffuser was designed conservatively:

- Moderate expansion angles
- Large cross-sectional area
- Low sensitivity to yaw

This resulted in robust performance rather than peak numbers.

---

### 4.2 Rear Wing Integration

The rear wing worked as part of a system:

- Positioned to interact with diffuser outwash
- Sized for endurance efficiency
- Tuned for stability in traffic and crosswinds

---

## 5. System-Level Trade-offs

Rather than optimising isolated components, the 787B exemplifies **system-level
aerodynamic thinking**:

- Cooling vs drag
- Peak downforce vs stability
- Qualifying pace vs 24-hour consistency

These trade-offs explain why the car succeeded in endurance conditions.

---

## 6. What Still Applies Today

Despite regulatory and technological changes, several principles remain
relevant:

- Pressure management beats peak suction
- Aerodynamic robustness matters in long races
- Integration always outperforms local optimisation

Modern LMH and LMDh cars reflect many of these same ideas.

---

## Conclusion

The Mazda 787B’s aerodynamic package was not extreme, but it was coherent,
robust, and purpose-driven. Its success reinforces a lesson that remains valid
today: in endurance racing, efficiency and stability often matter more than
headline downforce figures.
