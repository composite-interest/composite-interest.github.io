## Focus and approach

This site is a collaborative engineering blog focused on **how race cars actually work**.

We analyse motorsport and performance vehicles from an engineering perspective, linking
geometry, physics, regulation constraints, and system-level trade-offs. The goal is not
news, rumours, or speculation, but **technical understanding**.

Topics include:
- Aerodynamics and vehicle dynamics
- Cooling and thermal management
- Structural and materials engineering
- Powertrain and systems integration
- Regulation-driven design
- Historic and modern case studies across categories

Whenever possible, articles are structured **front to back**, moving from individual
components to full-vehicle behaviour.

## Who we are

The site is maintained by a small group of engineers working in motorsport and related
technical fields. Articles are written individually or collaboratively and reviewed with
technical accuracy as a priority.

### Core collaborators
- 4 regular contributors responsible for editorial direction and technical review

### Invited contributors
- Engineers, researchers, and practitioners invited to contribute specific analyses or
  perspectives
- Guest authors retain authorship of their work

Views expressed in individual articles are those of the author(s).

## Contributors

### Tomás Schuller  
*Aerodynamics and vehicle engineering*

Tomás Schuller is a mechanical engineer working in motorsport, with a focus on vehicle
aerodynamics and system integration. His experience spans aerodynamic surface design,
CFD analysis, and the definition of race car bodywork from early concepts through
detailed CAD.

His work typically focuses on:
- Aerodynamic architecture and flow control
- Front-to-rear vehicle integration
- Trade-offs between peak performance, robustness, and regulatory constraints
- Endurance and race-relevant operating conditions

He is particularly interested in analysing **why** specific design solutions emerge
within a given regulatory and operational context, rather than treating performance
figures in isolation.
